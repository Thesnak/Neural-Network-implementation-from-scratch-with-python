# Neural-Network-implementation-from-scratch-with-python-
This is a Python implementation of a simple 2-layer neural network. The network is designed to work with binary classification problems. The network consists of an input layer, a hidden layer with ReLU activation function and an output layer with sigmoid activation function.
